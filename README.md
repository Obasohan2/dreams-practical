## CONTENTS

<h2>Design</h2>

<h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

<p>>As the pages of the site have a background image, I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site quite small so as to not overwhelm users. Light brown and green are very typical colours in traditional Barber shop, with the milk & green used for upholstery.</p>

<p>In my css file I have used variables to declare colours, and then used these throughout the css file. I was recently introduced to this method during a code institute study and had some help from slack chat room - it is a useful convention to use as it allows you to alter the colour throughout the website if you decide to update a colour, by changing the colour once in the variable.</p>

<p>I have used #00806b & #000080 as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.<br>
I have used #ffffff as the overlay used over the sites background image.<br>
I have used #3a3a3a for the border-shadow of the header<br>
I have used rgba(203, 220, 200, 0.5) to display transparent background colour.</p>


<h3>Typography</h3>

<p>Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.<br>
 For the Page Title I have used the google font font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, sans-serif and lato, san-serif. This <br>is based on a calligraphy style and I have chosen them as their looks like the type of font you would see on a barber shop name sign</p>


<h3>Accessibility</h3>

<p>I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by: <br>
Using semantic HTML.<br>
Using a hover state on the nav element on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.<br>
Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.<br>
Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.</p>
