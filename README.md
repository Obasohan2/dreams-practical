## CONTENTS

<h2>Design</h2>

<h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

<p>As the pages of the site have a background image, I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site quite small so as to not overwhelm users. Light brown and green are very typical colours in traditional Barber shop, with the milk & green used for upholstery.</p>

<p>In my css file I have used variables to declare colours, and then used these throughout the css file. I was recently introduced to this method during a code institute study and had some help from slack chat room - it is a useful convention to use as it allows you to alter the colour throughout the website if you decide to update a colour, by changing the colour once in the variable.</p>

<p>I have used #00806b & #000080 as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.<br>
I have used #ffffff as the overlay used over the sites background image.<br>
I have used #3a3a3a for the border-shadow of the header<br>
I have used rgba(203, 220, 200, 0.5) to display transparent background colour.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<P>The website is comprised of a home page, gallery page and sign up page. All Pages on the website are responsive and have: A favicon in the browser tab.</P>

<h3>The Footer</h3>
<p><strong>The footer section</strong> includes links to the relevant social media sites for Barber Shop. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media and the copyright note</p>

<ul>
<li>Favicon</li>
</ul>
<p>The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page. The Barber Shop Title.</p>

<h3>The Home Page</h3>
<p>The home page of Barber Shop displays the sites name as a title and then a container which holds some cover text, including alerting the users that they can navigate back to the home page at any time by clicking on the page name. The home page contains the opening time of the barber shop.</p>
<p>The home page also have a feature for background image 5s zoom out.</p>

<h3>Gallery page</h3>
<p>The game page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page. This gallery page contains the photos of Barber Shop such as hair styling and hair cut.</p>

<h3>Future Implementations</h3>
<p>In future implementations I would like to:</p>
<p>I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:-</p>
<p>Using semantic HTML.</p>
<p>Using a hover state on all navigation menu buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia. Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site. contrast button Contrast button hover contrast text</p>
<p>In a future implementation I think it would be a great accessibility feature to also add a symbol such as a tick or cross on the answer button to enable people who are colour blind to also be able to access the webpage. </p>

<h3>Sign Up page</h3>
<p>The sign up page contain a form that required to be filled with user's details as requested, there are options for News letter, New Customer and Home service. It is colour friendly and very easily accessible.</p>

<h3>Typography</h3>

<p>Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.<br>
 For the Page Title I have used the google font font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, sans-serif and lato, san-serif. This <br>is based on a calligraphy style and I have chosen them as their looks like the type of font you would see on a barber shop name sign</p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by: <br>
Using semantic HTML.<br>
Using a hover state on the nav element on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.<br>
Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.<br>
Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.</p>
